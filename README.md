## 🌟 About the Project

This project started as a personal experiment to **automate video editing** for short-form content.  
Instead of spending hours cutting clips, adding captions, and syncing music, I wanted to build a tool that could do it **automatically**.

I used it to create a Backrooms YouTube channel — and with the help of this script, it grew to **50,000 subscribers** 🎉  

That growth showed me the power of combining:
- 🎥 Automation
- 🎶 Creativity
- 🤖 AI-assisted tools

Now I’m sharing the project so others can use it, improve it, or adapt it for their own content creation.


# 🎬 Auto Video Creator

This project automates the process of generating **short-form videos** with:
- Background footage
- Background music
- Auto-generated captions from speech transcription
- Sound effects and animations
- Optional comment and subscribe arrow overlays

It uses **MoviePy**, **Deepgram API**, **PyDub** to transform a simple voice recording (or YouTube video) into a fully edited, social-media-ready video.
