# THE PROJECT I USED IT FOR

As mentioned, I used this code to generate a channel with now over 50k subscribers. It is wildy impresive and kind of scary to think about it.
I have stoped uploading on the Youtube Chanel for a lot of time now and it is mostly to lack of revenue, I will share though the chanels name and some stats.
The inspiration comes from the multiple YT shorts with backrooms content. I thought that their editting could be automated and it could.

There are a lot of improvements to make and to be honest I believe that with consistency and a good plan, it could generate some income. Following similar methods, I believe most of internet brain-rot content could be completely automated (if they are not already automated).
In my case it did not, but I am pretty optimistic since the experiment clearly showed that although not human made, people (and especially kids)
are attracted to this kind of content..

Being honest, I do not encourage using it, the internet has suffered enough from this type of content. There is little money to make and a lot of luck involved. I know it is hypocritical for me to say this (the guy that both used it and published it) but it was fun creating this project and rewarding seeing it "succed". It is like eating fast food, it is bad for you,for the enviroment and we advise and are advised to avoid it. But (most of us) are guilty of succumbing to the tempetation and bad decision. 

It does not make it better, but it justifies its frequency...
