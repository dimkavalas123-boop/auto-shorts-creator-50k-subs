# HOW - TO - USE üìñ

There are already some footage, comment png, video recording etc in the folder. You may delete everythinh but NOT the silence.mp4 
video since it is used in the code.

‚ûù Step 1: Preparing...

!!!YOU NEED TO HAVE A DEEPGRAM API KEY, YOU CAN EASILY OPEN AN ACCOUNT FOR FREE (with limited tries)!!! ‚úÖ

- üé• Insert the video Footage you want to be played on your videos (You need at least 2 videos in the folder) 
- üé∂ Insert the background Music you want to be used
- üó£Ô∏è Insert the path of a video recording of the AI voice or you reading your script (in the main function, I am reffering to the parameter "path_video")
- ‚úçÔ∏è Insert the font you want the algorithm to use
- (Optional) Inser the sound effects you want to be used in the SampleSfxs folder


‚ûù Step 2: Creating Video
- While making the video, a sound file named speech.wav will be generated, it can be ignored and deleted after the creation of the video
- While making the video, a .mp4 file named "bg_footage_alone.mp4" will be generated, it can be ignored and deleted after the creation of the video


‚ûù Step 3: Finish 
- The video will be inputed to the Videos Folder with the indx = 0 after its name. The number refers to the tries you have gone through making this video.
- After the completion of the video you will be asked whether the result is satisfying or not. If yes, the process will end
- If not, the algorithm will start again the SECOND try (indx = 1). When done, the video will be inputed to the Videos folder with the indx = 1 after its name.
- This process will continue until satisfied

‚ö†Ô∏è !!! BEWARE !!! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- By retrying the process, it is not guranted that the result will be better. It is an algorithm, not an AI. Every critical decision (bg, music etc) is random
